<p>The origin of PinPoint's 3-D indoor navigation system began as a research and development project at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) located in Pittsburgh, PA. In 2016, the original intent of this project was to simplify paths of unfamiliar, vast and convoluted indoor environments for the visually impaired.
    The CMU team developed a sophisticated spatial mapping tool for indoor positioning and navigation, called "NavCog."</p>


<p>The Navcog development was a collaboration between CMU, IBM and Shimizu construction to provide indoor localization capacities to large complex environments and provide accessibility to those who need it. The project was led by Dr. Chieko Asakawa, an IBM Researcher in Watson Division and award-winning pioneer of providing technology with inclusivity and accessibility, along with Dr. Kris M. Kitani, a CMU Research Professor at the Robotics Institute, School of Computer Science.

Shortly after NavCog's development and testing, the technology was deployed into the University, Airport, Hospital, Hotel, Civic Center, Museum, and large office complex settings. It was very apparent that large corporations considered indoor mapping as a vital asset to their business.

    In 2018, PinPoint evolved and along with it, growth. As we continue to help the visually impaired, who are at the heart of our business, we welcome new opportunities; extending our services to other people and into more markets.</p>
